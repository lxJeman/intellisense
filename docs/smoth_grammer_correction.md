# Smooth Grammar Correction Concept Paper

## Idea - If user is typing fast and grammar is wrong, then it should correct it automatically and to make the experience sinless and smooth it will correct the previes sentazies one by one

Hello evryone my nema is Alex. I like very much progarming and im very good at web dev. i would like to make new frisnts todya.

So in this example we have 3 sentazeies, each by one it will correct them:

- Deteting 3 sentaties!
- Correcting sentaze nr.1: "Hello evryone my nema is Alex." ---> "Hello everyone my name is Alex."
- Correcting sentaze nr.2: "I like very much progarming and im very good at web dev." ---> "I like very much programming and I very good at web development."
- Correcting sentaze nr.3: "i would like to make new frisnts todya." ---> "I would like to make new friends today."

IMPORTEND NOTES: if the last sentaze is not finised aka . ? ! is missing dont correct it and it will be considered as active aka dont grammerly corrrect unless the default 3sec rate limiter is up and its time for the main loop
