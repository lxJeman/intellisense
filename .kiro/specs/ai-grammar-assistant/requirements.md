# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Grammar Assistant is a Chrome extension that provides real-time grammar correction and autocomplete suggestions for users typing in web forms and text areas. The extension leverages the Groq LLaMA 3 (8B) API to analyze user input and provide intelligent text improvements, helping users write more effectively across all websites.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a web user, I want real-time grammar corrections while typing in any text field, so that I can improve my writing quality without interrupting my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in any text input field or textarea THEN the system SHALL monitor the text input in real-time
2. WHEN text contains grammar errors THEN the system SHALL send the text to the Groq API for correction
3. WHEN grammar corrections are received THEN the system SHALL highlight or suggest corrections inline
4. WHEN a user accepts a correction THEN the system SHALL replace the incorrect text seamlessly without disrupting cursor position

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a web user, I want autocomplete suggestions while typing, so that I can write faster and more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is typing in a text field THEN the system SHALL provide contextual autocomplete suggestions
2. WHEN autocomplete suggestions are available THEN the system SHALL display them as ghost text or inline suggestions
3. WHEN a user presses Tab or clicks on a suggestion THEN the system SHALL accept and insert the suggested text
4. WHEN multiple suggestions are available THEN the system SHALL allow users to cycle through options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a web user, I want the extension to work efficiently without slowing down my typing, so that I can maintain my natural writing flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types rapidly THEN the system SHALL debounce API requests to avoid excessive calls
2. WHEN identical text has been processed before THEN the system SHALL use cached results instead of making new API calls
3. WHEN API calls are in progress THEN the system SHALL not block user typing or input
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle errors without disrupting the user experience

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a web user, I want to control when and how the grammar assistant works, so that I can customize it to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the extension popup THEN the system SHALL provide toggle controls for grammar correction and autocomplete features
2. WHEN a user disables grammar correction THEN the system SHALL stop monitoring and correcting text
3. WHEN a user adjusts sensitivity settings THEN the system SHALL apply the new settings to future corrections
4. WHEN a user wants to see usage statistics THEN the system SHALL display API call counts and cost information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a web user, I want the extension to work across different websites and input types, so that I have consistent writing assistance everywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits any website with text inputs THEN the system SHALL automatically inject content scripts
2. WHEN a user types in single-line inputs, textareas, or contenteditable elements THEN the system SHALL provide assistance
3. WHEN a user types in popular websites like Gmail, LinkedIn, Twitter, or Notion THEN the system SHALL work without conflicts
4. WHEN a website has complex text editors THEN the system SHALL handle edge cases like caret positioning and undo operations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a web user, I want my API keys and usage to be secure and cost-effective, so that I can use the service without concerns about security or unexpected charges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension makes API calls THEN the system SHALL securely store and use API credentials
2. WHEN text segments are repeated THEN the system SHALL cache results to minimize API costs
3. WHEN API usage reaches certain thresholds THEN the system SHALL provide usage warnings or limits
4. WHEN the extension handles user data THEN the system SHALL not store or transmit personal information unnecessarily

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a web user, I want the extension to handle errors gracefully, so that technical issues don't disrupt my writing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail due to network issues THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
2. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL queue requests and inform the user
3. WHEN invalid API responses are received THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue functioning
4. WHEN the extension encounters unexpected website structures THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully without breaking page functionality
