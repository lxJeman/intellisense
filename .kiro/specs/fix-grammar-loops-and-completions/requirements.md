# Fix Grammar Loops and Improve Completions

## Introduction

The current system has critical issues: grammar correction runs multiple times causing language changes, and sentence completion/continuation features provide generic responses instead of contextual suggestions. We need to fix these issues to provide a smooth user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Prevent Multiple Grammar Corrections

**User Story:** As a user, I want grammar correction to run only once per text input, so that my text doesn't get translated to different languages through multiple corrections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text is corrected by grammar system THEN it SHALL NOT be corrected again until user makes new changes
2. WHEN corrected text is detected THEN the system SHALL skip grammar processing to prevent loops
3. WHEN user continues typing after correction THEN only new content SHALL be processed for grammar
4. WHEN text has been processed recently THEN the system SHALL use a flag to prevent re-processing
5. WHEN grammar correction is applied THEN the system SHALL mark that text as "already corrected"

### Requirement 2: Fix Language Detection Consistency

**User Story:** As a user typing in one language, I want the system to maintain language consistency throughout the session, so that my text doesn't get translated to random languages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN language is detected for a text input THEN it SHALL remain consistent for that session
2. WHEN grammar correction is applied THEN it SHALL preserve the originally detected language
3. WHEN multiple corrections occur THEN they SHALL all use the same detected language
4. WHEN language changes unexpectedly THEN the system SHALL log a warning and revert to original language
5. WHEN user types in the same language repeatedly THEN the system SHALL cache and reuse the language detection

### Requirement 3: Improve Sentence Completion

**User Story:** As a user who completes a sentence, I want to receive ONE relevant completion suggestion, so that I can continue my thought naturally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sentence completion is requested THEN the system SHALL return ONE contextually relevant completion
2. WHEN completion is generated THEN it SHALL be in the same language as the input text
3. WHEN completion is displayed THEN it SHALL be a natural continuation of the user's thought
4. WHEN completion is applied THEN it SHALL add meaningful content, not generic responses
5. WHEN completion fails THEN the system SHALL not display generic placeholder text

### Requirement 4: Improve Continuation Suggestions

**User Story:** As a user who pauses while typing, I want to receive ONE relevant continuation suggestion based on my context, so that I can continue writing smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN continuation is triggered THEN the system SHALL provide ONE contextually appropriate suggestion
2. WHEN continuation is generated THEN it SHALL be based on the existing text context
3. WHEN continuation is displayed THEN it SHALL be in the same language as the input
4. WHEN continuation is clicked THEN it SHALL add meaningful content that flows naturally
5. WHEN continuation cannot be generated THEN no suggestion SHALL be shown

### Requirement 5: Implement Processing State Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to track processing states properly, so that we can prevent loops and duplicate processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text is being processed THEN the system SHALL set a processing flag
2. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL clear the processing flag
3. WHEN text is already processed THEN the system SHALL skip re-processing
4. WHEN user makes new changes THEN the processing flag SHALL be reset
5. WHEN multiple processes try to run simultaneously THEN only one SHALL be allowed

## Technical Considerations

- Add processing state flags to prevent multiple grammar corrections
- Implement language consistency checks to prevent random language changes
- Improve AI prompts for sentence completion to get actual completions, not generic responses
- Add context-aware continuation that provides meaningful suggestions
- Implement proper debouncing and state management to prevent processing loops

## Success Criteria

- Grammar correction runs only once per text input
- Language remains consistent throughout the session
- Sentence completion provides relevant, contextual suggestions
- Continuation suggestions are meaningful and contextually appropriate
- No more processing loops or duplicate corrections
- System provides smooth, predictable user experience
