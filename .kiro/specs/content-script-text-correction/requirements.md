# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Content Script Text Correction & Autocomplete UI feature implements a seamless, real-time text correction and autocomplete system that works directly within web page input fields. Instead of using a popup interface, this system monitors text inputs across websites and provides inline grammar corrections and autocomplete suggestions while preserving the user's original language and typing flow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a web user, I want real-time grammar corrections applied directly to input fields while I type, so that my text is improved without disrupting my workflow or requiring popup interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in any supported input field THEN the system SHALL monitor text changes using debounced event handling
2. WHEN text contains grammar errors THEN the system SHALL send the text to the grammar correction API
3. WHEN grammar corrections are received THEN the system SHALL replace the text in the input field seamlessly
4. WHEN text replacement occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve the user's cursor position and selection state
5. WHEN corrections are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain the original language of the text universally (Russian, Spanish, French, etc.)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a web user, I want autocomplete suggestions displayed as ghost text in input fields, so that I can quickly accept suggestions with Tab or click without interrupting my typing flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user pauses typing THEN the system SHALL generate contextual autocomplete suggestions
2. WHEN autocomplete suggestions are available THEN the system SHALL display them as ghost text or inline overlay
3. WHEN a user presses Tab key THEN the system SHALL accept and insert the suggested text
4. WHEN a user clicks on the suggestion THEN the system SHALL accept and insert the suggested text
5. WHEN a user continues typing THEN the system SHALL hide the current suggestion and generate new ones

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a web user, I want the system to work across all common input types and websites, so that I have consistent text assistance everywhere I type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the content script loads THEN the system SHALL monitor all input fields defined in getTextInputSelectors()
2. WHEN monitoring input fields THEN the system SHALL support: input[type="text"], input[type="email"], input[type="search"], input[type="url"], input[type="tel"], textarea, contenteditable elements, and rich editor selectors
3. WHEN new input fields are dynamically added to the page THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and monitor them
4. WHEN working with rich text editors THEN the system SHALL handle complex DOM structures like Quill, Draft.js, and Google Docs
5. WHEN password fields are encountered THEN the system SHALL NOT monitor them for security reasons

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a web user, I want the text correction system to be efficient and not slow down my typing, so that I can maintain my natural writing speed and flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types rapidly THEN the system SHALL use debouncing to prevent excessive API calls
2. WHEN identical text has been processed recently THEN the system SHALL use cached results instead of making new API requests
3. WHEN API calls are in progress THEN the system SHALL not block or interfere with user typing
4. WHEN multiple corrections are needed THEN the system SHALL queue them appropriately to avoid conflicts
5. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without disrupting the user experience

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a web user, I want grammar corrections to be highlighted or visually indicated, so that I can see what changes were made to my text.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN grammar corrections are applied THEN the system SHALL optionally highlight the corrected text
2. WHEN corrections are highlighted THEN the system SHALL use subtle visual indicators that don't interfere with the page design
3. WHEN a user hovers over corrected text THEN the system SHALL show the original text as a tooltip
4. WHEN highlighting is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide a way to toggle this feature on/off
5. WHEN corrections are made THEN the system SHALL fade the highlighting after a reasonable time period

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a web user, I want the system to handle complex input scenarios gracefully, so that it works reliably across different websites and input types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with multi-line inputs THEN the system SHALL preserve line breaks and formatting
2. WHEN the user performs undo operations THEN the system SHALL not interfere with browser undo functionality
3. WHEN the cursor is positioned mid-text THEN the system SHALL handle corrections without disrupting cursor placement
4. WHEN input fields have character limits THEN the system SHALL respect those limits when applying corrections
5. WHEN working with form validation THEN the system SHALL not trigger false validation errors

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a web user, I want the system to preserve my original language consistently, so that my Russian text stays in Russian, my Spanish text stays in Spanish, etc.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text is written in any language THEN the system SHALL detect and preserve that language throughout the correction process
2. WHEN grammar corrections are applied THEN they SHALL maintain the original language without translation
3. WHEN autocomplete suggestions are generated THEN they SHALL be in the same language as the input text
4. WHEN language detection is uncertain THEN the system SHALL err on the side of preserving the original text
5. WHEN multiple languages are mixed in one input THEN the system SHALL handle each section appropriately

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a web user, I want the system to work without conflicts on popular websites, so that I can use it reliably on sites I visit frequently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Gmail, LinkedIn, Twitter, or Notion THEN the system SHALL work without breaking existing functionality
2. WHEN websites have their own autocomplete or spell-check features THEN the system SHALL coexist without conflicts
3. WHEN websites use complex JavaScript frameworks THEN the system SHALL adapt to dynamic content changes
4. WHEN websites have custom input handling THEN the system SHALL detect and work around potential conflicts
5. WHEN the system encounters incompatible websites THEN it SHALL gracefully disable itself for those sites
